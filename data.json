Constructed in 1965, the observatory is a red brick building with a 16-inch Cassegrain reflector optical telescope. It is used for several community events and is regularly open for public viewing on Thursday nights. Originally the observatory was home to a 20” telescope, given to the department by an avid amateur who lived in central Massachusetts. It was a 1/10 scale model (loosely) of a larger 200” scope. Eventually, a crack was spotted  during one of the re-aluminizings of the 20” mirror and the scope was no more. In the meantime, the department had been granted money associated with its move from Hasbrouck to the Grad Research Tower to buy a small telescope and put in on top of the GRC. The GRC had a small \"isolation\" pad built on its roof, which was supposed to be a mount for the scope, which could be accessed via a small open elevator. However, the GRC had terrible noise and gross vibration problems. The isolation pad never worked and there were too many safety concerns about using the roof of the building for observing. A 16\" telescope was later bought from Competition Associates (a racing car company).  That scope arrived in 1976 but because of the problems with using the top of the GRC, the scope was never mounted there.  In fact, it sat in the basement of Hasbrouck for perhaps 10 years, becoming known as the \"Subterranean Telescope.” This situation finally led to the 20\" being disassembled and the 16\" scope being moved to Orchard Hill and installed in the dome there.  The 16\" was a major improvement in usability. As to what happened to the 20\", the mirror may have been stored in the Astronomy Research Facility but the drive was most likely not kept.\n","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Orchard_Hill_Observatory.jpg/250px-Orchard_Hill_Observatory.jpg","table":[{"type":"Organization","value":"Orchard Hill Observatory, circa 2011"},{"type":"Location","value":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"type":"Coordinates","value":"Amherst, Massachusetts, United States"},{"type":"Altitude","value":"42°23′38.62″N 72°31′17.63″W﻿ / ﻿42.3940611°N 72.5215639°W﻿ / 42.3940611; -72.5215639Coordinates: 42°23′38.62″N 72°31′17.63″W﻿ / ﻿42.3940611°N 72.5215639°W﻿ / 42.3940611; -72.5215639"},{"type":"Weather","value":"413 feet"},{"type":"Established","value":"Amherst Weather"},{"type":"Website","value":"1965[1]"},{"type":"Telescopes","value":"Orchard Hill Observatory"},{"type":" ","value":" Group 128 Inc.

The primary mirror has a special lightweight honeycomb design made by the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory.\nThe MMT is housed in a building which allows the walls and roof around the telescope to be completely rolled back, allowing it to cool down very quickly in order to improve  observation.\n","img":"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/MMT_Observatory.jpg/220px-MMT_Observatory.jpg","table":[{"type":"Alternative names","value":"MMT Observatory"},{"type":"Part of","value":"MMTO "},{"type":"Location(s)","value":"Fred Lawrence Whipple ObservatorySteward Observatory "},{"type":"Coordinates","value":"Arizona"},{"type":"Organization","value":"31°41′18″N 110°53′06″W﻿ / ﻿31.6883°N 110.885°W﻿ / 31.6883; -110.885Coordinates: 31°41′18″N 110°53′06″W﻿ / ﻿31.6883°N 110.885°W﻿ / 31.6883; -110.885 "},{"type":"Observatory code","value":"University of Arizona "},{"type":"Altitude","value":" 696 "},{"type":"Telescope style","value":"2,616 m (8,583 ft) "},{"type":"Diameter","value":"optical telescope "},{"type":"Mounting","value":"6.5 m (21 ft 4 in)  "},{"type":"Website","value":"altazimuth mount  "}]},{"name":"Mount Graham International Observatory","body":"Mount Graham International Observatory (MGIO) is a division of Steward Observatory, the research arm for the Department of Astronomy at The University of Arizona, in the United States.
